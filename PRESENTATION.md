# Public Git
1. I want version control
1. I want to share
1. "Reporoduceable event stream as commit messages"

---

# Start with a Makefile
1. Always available
1. Steps to install, run, demo, cleanup, reset, etc
1. It's a 3rd of the "3 Musketeers" pattern
    - https://3musketeers.io/guide/make.html

# Ruby demo
```ruby
puts "hello world"
```

_press CTRL-e to execute_

---

## In Review

- put it in git and share it
- event stream as commit messages
- a build script/Makefile will make it easier

## Thank You
